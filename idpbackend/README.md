# Installing docker and docker compose.
<details>
  <summary>Steps for installing docker.</summary>
  
  ```
    1. Update the apt package index and install packages to allow apt to use a repository over HTTPS:

```bash
sudo apt-get update

sudo apt-get install \
    apt-transport-https \
    ca-certificates \
    curl \
    gnupg \
    lsb-release
```

2. Add Dockerâ€™s official GPG key:

```bash
 curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /usr/share/keyrings/docker-archive-keyring.gpg
 ```

3. Use the following command to set up the stable repository. To add the nightly or test repository, add the word nightly or test (or both) after the word stable in the commands below.

```bash
echo \
  "deb [arch=amd64 signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/docker-archive-keyring.gpg] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu \
  $(lsb_release -cs) stable" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list > /dev/null
```

4. Update the apt package index, and install the latest version of Docker Engine and containerd, or go to the next step to install a specific version:

```bash
 sudo apt-get update
 sudo apt-get install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io
 ```

 **Install Docker Compose on Linux System**
1. Run this command to download the current stable release of Docker Compose:

```bash
 sudo curl -L "https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/1.29.2/docker-compose-$(uname -s)-$(uname -m)" -o /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
```

2. Apply executable permissions to the binary:

```bash
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
```

3. Test the installation.
```bash
docker-compose --version
```
